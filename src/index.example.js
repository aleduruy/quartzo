      Quartzo is a Javascript Framework that provides normalised React and React-native components, wich means that every component here can be reused on both web and native applications.
      All of them follows the concepts of Atomic Design, a methodology that can offer a good Design System hierarchy for the page that will use them.

      The major principles of Quartzo includes the reuse of code, once it's written just one time, the performance of the applications, the visual patterns that a design system can offer, and the accessibility of the page in the case of the web environment.
